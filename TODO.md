# TODO: Edit Login View to Fit Screen, Prevent Scrolling, and Improve Aesthetics

- [x] Edit app/Views/auth/login.php: Add 'overflow: hidden;' and 'height: 100vh;' to the body CSS selector in the <style> tag to make the login page fit the screen and non-scrollable.
- [x] Edit app/Views/auth/login.php: Reduce logo width from 300px to 200px for better aesthetics.
